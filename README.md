 // Exercise or Lab name: Figma your Life

 // Brief Description of what you did: Created 3 web pages that includes Landing page, interests page and accomplishments page; using bootstraph and figma

// Peer Review: Jayvon Khuth - The whole website itself looks very neat and clean. I liked how everything was very simple and I felt like I could read all of his text/descriptions pretty well. Looking at his code, I like how he made use of the absolute position and how he positioned most things on his website with percentages, so that his website is responsive to my screen. Looking at his figma, to make his website look more like the figma I would recommend to change the colors of everything to the exact colors in figma. The only bug I found in his website was that in his nav bar you were able to click things, but they took you nowhere.
//I corrected the bug and made the nave text/icon unclickable (AN)
